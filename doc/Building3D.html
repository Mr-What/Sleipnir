    <h1>Building standoff-hinged Walking Linkage, 3D printed</h1>
<P>
<IMG align="right" SRC="JansenLinkages.png" width="500">
This drawing will help explain my conventions for naming parts
of the linkage:
</P>

<P>For a complete chassis hardware setup, using 3/16" OD standoff hinges you will want :
<UL><LI>(2) gearhead motors</LI>
<LI>motor driver module</LI>
<LI>(2) 3/16" OD brass tubes or steel rods, 1 foot long</LI>
<LI>CA cement, gap filling, medium-viscosity
<LI>(16) 1/2" long, 3/16" OD standoffs for #4-40 screws</LI>
<LI>(24) 3/16" long, 3/16" OD standoffs for #4-40 screws</LI>
<LI>(2) #4-40 0.25 to 0.75 inch threaded rods.
<BR>Can be made by cutting the head off of a screw, and then cleaning the threads.
<LI>(76) 5/16" long #4-40 pan or round-head screws</LI>
<LI>(74+) #4 flat washers
<LI>(4) #4 larger diameter flat washers, if available.  (standard diameter is OK)
<BR>If washers are thin, may need to double some for clearance on 5/16" #4-40 screws, or replace some 5/16" screws with 1/4"</LI>
<LI>(74) #4 internal tooth lockwashers</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The 3/16" OD standoffs are fairly rare.
I can sell some for slightly above cost.
I intend to offer full hardware packages, including these standoffs, soon.
</P>

<H2>Drills</H2>
After 3D printing the linkage, holes may need to be precision drilled.

<TABLE BORDER>
<TR><TH>Bit</TH><TH>Notes</TH></TD></TR>

<TR><TH>#10</TH>
<TD>free on 3/16" OD axle and standoffs</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>#11</TH>
<TD>[optional.  #10 should work]<BR>free on 3/16" OD axle and standoffs, if "polished" after drill</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>#12</TH>
<TD>Snug (but not press-fit) on 3/16" OD, good for non-moving connections to B-axle</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>#35</TH>
<TD>snug, but free around #4-40 screw</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<H2>Chassis assembly</H2>
Chassis assembly is organized in four steps:
<OL>
<LI><A HREF="PartsPrep3D.html">Parts preparation</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="GluedParts3D.html">Glued parts</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="LegAssembly3D.html">Leg sub-assemblies</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="PayloadAssembly3D.html">Payload assembly</A>
<LI><A HREF="MainAssembly3D.html">Main chassis integration</A></LI>
</OL>

This completes the base of a fairly typical robot chassis, with dual motor control.

<P>I will be publishing my design for running this chassis over a Bluetooth remote
control soon.
It uses an open-source Android app to send control commands to a Bluetooth receiver,
attached to an Arduino nano compatible microcontroller module.
The motors are controlled from a fairly common LM298 based motor control module.

<P>Recommended assembly order:
  <OL><LI>Print and glue parts that need to be glued.
      <OL type="a"><LI><B>Print pulleys and crank arms (AC)</B>.
	  <BR>2 main pulleys, 2 motor pulleys, 4 (AC) crank arms.</LI>
	<LI><B>Print main bars (4)</B></LI>
	<LI><B>Print motor mounts (2)</B></LI>
	<LI>Glue motor mounts to main bars</LI>
	<LI>Glue standoffs to main pulley (for each side)</LI>
	<LI>Assemble main pulley into main bar (twice, once for each side)</LI>
	<LI>Glue crankarms (AC) onto main pulley standoffs.
	  <BR>Make sure they are glued/locked at level 180 degree phase.</LI>
	<LI><B>Print hips</B></LI>
	<LI>Glue forks onto Hips.</LI>
      </OL>

    <LI>Print rest of one pair of leg assemblies
      <UL>
	<LI>You should have already printed and glued all 8 hip parts, 4 of each of the 2 mirror symmetries.
	  <BR>You will need one of each of the symmetries to build a leg pair.
	  <B>
	<LI>(4) EF links</LI>
	<LI>(4) BH links</LI>
	<LI>(2) CH links
	  <BR>(2) CD links</LI>
	<LI>(2) feet, one of each symmetry</LI>
	</B>
      </UL>
      <BR>Clean support material from foot/hamstring node.
      <BR>Polish 3/16" hole surfaces.
    </LI>
    <LI>Construct a pair of legs, check for smoothness of operation.</LI>
    <LI>Once operation of leg pair has been verified, <B>print rest of another leg pair</B></LI>
    <LI>Complete assembly of one side of legs (4 legs on a main bar, with motor drive), and mount on axles</LI>
    <LI>Test motor operation with a small battery.</LI>
    <LI><B>Print payload mounts</B>, and mount on axles</LI>
    <LI>Repeat steps 2 to 6 for other set of 4 legs</LI>
    <LI>Mount other leg set on axles.</LI>
    <LI>[optional] Print and mount outside brace bars</LI>
    <LI>Complete payload electronics assembly</LI>
  </OL>
