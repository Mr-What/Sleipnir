  <TR><TH>D-fork on Hip has push rods near top or bottom.
      <P>This drawing shows wide fork, so that it can be used with
	CD crankLink either on top or bottom.
	<BR>We may choose weather crankLink is top or bottom, then mount
	a thinner fork which is near the top or the bottom of span as needed.
	<P>Sean O'Connor has some scrap 2x1 tubes

  <TR><TH>E-fork on Hip could have push-rods all centered.
      <BR>We could go with a thinner fork piece, like from a 2x1 box tube,
      and center it on the rod.
      <P>Note that the placement of this rod on the F joint tube will
	be critical for alignment.  (do a drawing of this placement...)

  <TR><TH>Profile view of B-joint (axle)
      <BR>Shows widths collars
      <P>Note that center of main Hip plane is
	1.2cm above bottom of B collar piece.
      <P>Side of BH fork closer to hip main plane
	has rod center 0.85cm below top edge of collar, as drawn.
      <P><EM>Outrigger</EM> side of BH fork has rod center 0.85cm
	above bottom of collar as drawn.

      <P>NOTE: change the collar widths, then the rod offsets change too.
	Things need to stay level in Z plane

    <TR><TH>Profile view of H-joint (hamstring)
	<P>Haven't annotated much.
	  Distances less critical.
	  I intend to keep things mostly in-plane with spacers.
	  Make sure that BH links are nice and square.
	  Heim joints on Foot assembly need to be aligned so that
	  the bolt through them is square to plane of motion, and thinner
	  than BH forks, but space can be filled as necessary with washers.
